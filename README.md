# Machine-learning-Voice-Assistant

## Anna - A Voice Command driven Virtual Assistant for running Statistical Analysis

The idea is to create a voice enabled assistant which can run automated statistical analysis on any given dataset and any model on top of it.

Check the demo video in DEMO folder for a glimpse of how the assistant works on voice commands.
